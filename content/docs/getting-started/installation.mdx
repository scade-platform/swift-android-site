# Installation

The Swift Toolchain for Android is available in different formats. Depending on your needs, you can either install it via a package manager Brew, download a standalone package, or use it directly in Android Studio.

## Installation via Brew

If you plan to use the toolchain from the command-line, for example, the easiest way to install the Swift Toolchain for Android is by installing *scd*, the *SCADE Build Tool*, via the Homebrew package manager. 
The scd tool will install all the necessary components for building Swift code for Android. To install *scd* via Brew, run the following command:

```bash
brew install scade-platform/toolchain/scd
```
This will install the latest version of the SCADE Build Tool that will automatically download the latest Swift Toolchain for Android and set up the environment for you. The *scd* tool will also take care of checking and installing new versions of the Swift Toolchain for Android when you run it.
For more information on how to use the *scd* tool, please refer to the [SCADE Build Tool Usage](#scade-build-tool).

**NOTE**: the *scd* tool depends on the Swift version and hence it is recommended to use the latest version of the SCADE Build Tool. If you have an older version installed, you can update it by running:

```bash
brew upgrade scade-platform/toolchain/scd
```

## Standalone package

The Swift Toolchain for Android can also be installed as a standalone package. 
This package includes the Swift compiler for Android as well as the *scd* build tool that will update the Swift Toolchain for Android automatically when a new version is available.

You can download standalone installer from [SCADE Build Tool Releases](https://github.com/scade-platform/swift-android-toolchain/releases) and just run the installer. By default, the installer will install the toolchain in ```$HOME/Library/Developer/Scade/Toolchains``` directory.	

## Android Studio

If you prefer to use the Swift Toolchain for Android directly in Android Studio, you can install the *Swift Packages for Gradle* plugin. 
The plugin will automatically download and install the latest version of the Swift Toolchain for Android and will also check for new versions automatically. 
To use the plugin in your Android Studio project just add the plugin's id into the plugins block in the project's build file ```build.gradle.kts```

```kotlin
plugins { 
    id("io.scade.gradle.plugins.swiftpm") version "1.1.1"
}
```

For more information on how to use the plugin, please refer to the [Swift Packages for Gradle](#swift-packages-for-gradle).

# Usage

## SCADE Build Tool

### Building an SPM project for Android platform
To build an SPM project for the Android platform, run the `scd build` command from the root of the SPM project and specify one of the Android platforms to build for:

```bash
scd build --platform android-arm64-v8a
```

This command will automatically install the Swift toolchain for Android and build the SPM project for the desired Android platform.


### Archiving an SPM project for Android

The `scd` build tool can build an SPM project for multiple Android platforms and archive it into a single directory suitable for embedding into Android projects. To create an archive, run the `scd archive` command with the set of Android platforms you want to build:

```bash
scd archive --platform android-arm64-v8a \
            --platform android-x86_64 \
            --platform android-armeabi-v7a \
            --platform android-x86
```

The resulting archive directory will be placed into the `lib` subdirectory of the current working directory. You can change the output directory using the -o argument.

### Running an SPM exectuable on the Android platform

To run an SPM executable product on an Android device or emulator, simply execute the `scd run` command and pass the executable product name along with the Android platform you want to run it on:

```bash
scd run --platform android-arm64-v8a --product myexecutable
```

This will automatically build and archive the `myexecutable` product for the specified platform, install it on the running device or emulator, and execute it.

If you want to automatically launch an Android emulator, you can pass the AVD image name to the `scd run` command using the `--device` option:

```bash
scd run --platform android-arm64-v8a --product myexecutable --device AVDName
```


### Archiving an SPM project into .aar library
The `scd` build tool can also archive an SPM project into an Android .aar library.

Archiving into an .aar library requires a valid `AndroidManifest.xml` located inside the SPM project root. The manifest should contain at least the package ID and version information:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    package="com.example.scadeexample"
    android:versionCode="1"
    android:versionName="1.0">
</manifest>
```

To create an .aar archive, pass the additional `--type android-aar` argument to the `scd archive` command:
```bash
scd archive --type android-aar
            --platform android-arm64-v8a \
            --platform android-x86_64
```

## Swift Packages for Gradle

The *Swift Packages for Gradle* plugin allows you to use Swift packages in your Android projects.
To use the plugin, you need to add it to your project's `build.gradle.kts` file as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.
The main advantage of using the plugin compared to using the *scd* tool directly is that besides building Swift libraries for Android, 
it also generates all necessary Java bindigns for the Swift libraries and packages everything inside an Android application making the integration of Swift packages as seamless as possible.

### Adding a Swift package to an Android project

To add a Swift package to your Android project, you need to add the `swiftpm` block in your project's `build.gradle.kts` file:
```kotlin
    swiftpm { 
        // Path to the Swift package root directory
        path = file("<PACKAGE LOCATION>")
        
        // Name of the product to build
        product = "<PRODUCT NAME>"

        // OPTIONAL: Java version (8, 9, 11, ...) used for the generated code compatibility        
        javaVersion = 8 // (default: Java 11)
    }        
```

The block specify the path to the Swift package root directory, the name of the product from the Swift Package to build and link to the application, and the Java version used for the generated code compatibility. 
The ```javaVersion``` parameter is optional but often required to ensure that the generated Java code is compatible with the Android API level. Please, refer to the official Android documentation for more information on the [Java versions in Android builds](https://developer.android.com/build/jdks).
