# Supported Libraries 

You can use a large number of Swift libraries on Android. The following chapter provides some insights and a list of tested libraries

## General rule
You can use any Swift library on Android that fits the following criteria 

### Option 1: Libraries available as source code
* Library is available as Swift source code 

* Depends only on Open Source Libraries such as
    * Swift Foundation
    * Swift Dispatch
    * Swift-log
    * ...
    
* Does not depend on
    * Closed source libraries

* Does not include objC code

    
### Option 2: Libaries available as Android binary
* C library that is precompiled and runs on Android ARM / x86
* A good example is SQLite


## List of libraries
Here is our list of libraries we tested and/or provide examples for

* We continously add to this list
* If your libraries is not on the list, it **doesnt mean it doesnt work**, we just haven't provided an example yet or tested it officially
* There are 100s of libraries that work and are not listed here
* If you want to add a library here or have a desire to support a specific library, please contact us on Discord
