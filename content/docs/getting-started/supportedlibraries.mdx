title: Supported Libraries
description: You can use a large number of Swift libraries on Android. The following chapter provides some insights and a list of libraries
---
## General rules for use on Android
You can use and compile any Swift library on Android that fits the following criteria 

### Option 1: Libraries available as source code
* Library is available as Swift source code 
* Depends only on Open Source Libraries such as Swift Foundation, Swift Dispatch
* Does not depend on Closed Source libraries
* Does not include objC code

    
### Option 2: Libaries available as Android binary
* C library that is precompiled and runs on Android ARM / x86
* A good example is SQLite


## List of libraries
Here is our list of libraries we tested and/or provide examples for. Remember the list of libraries to you is sheer endless. They simple have to fit the general rules above.

If your libraries is not on the list, it **doesnt mean it doesnt work**, we just haven't provided an example
