#Supported Libraries

You can use a large number of Swift libraries on Android. The following chapter provides some insights and a list of tested libraries

## General rule
You can use any Swift library on Android that fits the following criteria

### Option 1: Libaries available as source code
* Available as Swift source code
* Depends only on one or more of the following system libraries
	* Swift Foundation
	* Swift libdispatch

### Option 2: Libaries available Android binary
* C library that is precompiled and runs on Android ARM / x86
* A good example is SQLite


## List of libraries
Here is our list of libraries tested. We continously add to this list. The libraries can be very easy be added to the project in Android using Gradle and the maven dependency

|Category  | Library name | Description | Example | Demostrated |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| General  | Swift Foundation   | Access all Foundation functionality in Android   |  [WeatherService](https://github.com/scade-platform/swift4j-examples/tree/main/Packages/WeatherService)  | HTTP|
| Database  | SQLite   | Use SQLite on Android   |   |SQLite|
| Database |  [GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift)  | Use of GRDB on Android   | [SimpleDB](https://github.com/scade-platform/swift4j-examples/blob/main/Packages/SimpleDB/Sources/SimpleDB/Database.swift) | GRDB
